6x6 grid
5 regular towns
6 regular dungeons
1 snowy town
1 end lava town
6 temples that require a password in order to enter and get the legendary gear
10 treasure chests on the map that only have normal loot like money and potions

when you complete a dungeon, you learn of a temple password

6 types of gear:
helmet
armor
shield
sword
ring
amulet

maps need to have "encounter levels" that have a label, just like the map x,y label, and the encounters are based on the random encounter level
it helps you figure out if you should be on that map or not, like if you're level 1 and you go to a map with encounter level 5, it's probably not a good idea
maybe there can be 10 levels in total?
